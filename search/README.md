# Search

## Goal

The search should be a delightful little tool which allows you to quickly search for code examples of a specific function

## Wishlist
- [ ] lazy search
- [ ] ranking functions based on usage (list most used functions first)
- [ ] rank examples
  - [ ] Give examples from own repo higher ranking
- [ ] perma links for search results

## State Diagram

I've heard about [sketch.systems](https://sketch.systems/) on the [Future of Coding podcast](http://futureofcoding.org/episodes/25).
It's a little tool that allows you to sketch out interaction flows for your ui components. It turned out quite useful to think about the states and transitions in a systematic way.
